# NEWTSS
An algorithm to estimate the error in the wave telescope method as a function of wavevector magnitude.

## Methods


## How to Use

```
hour = 94                       # Configuration hour of HS Phase B DRM mission
std_coef = 2                    # see above
```

```
Er_thres = 20                   # see above
```
